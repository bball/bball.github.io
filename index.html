	<p>Room for rent in an extremely spacious 2200 sqft 4 bedroom condo at UE Square Residences. Ideally situated at the edge of Robertson Quay next to Fort Canning Park, the river, and Blue Line Fort Canning Station with 7 minute MRT to CBD, or 15 minute walk/bike ride to CBD along the river.<br><br>

We are a family, married couple with a 14 month old son and a helper. Grandmother stays in the guestroom for 4 nights a week too, but is working during daytime (and helps take care of the baby when she is here in the evening).<br><br>

The room is the corner junior master all the way down the hall at the end of the house (thus it is quiet from the common living room). Floor to ceiling windows at treetop level (4th floor) brings a lot of light in and nice greenery. Double glazed windows means very little sound from outside. The bedroom includes your own ensuite bathroom with shower. Also includes large closets, a queen size bed with nice mattress, desk, chest of drawers, and still quite a lot of space in the room to spare.<br><br>

The house common areas include a piano room near the kitchen, the kitchen (including new large refrigerator, new oven, new stove), a new washing machine, two balconies facing fraser place with trees all around and a quiet street, a living room with a cosy seating area, a dining area surrounded by bright windows, and a library area with a nice chair and lamp for relaxing and reading.<br><br>

Price is $2000/month negotiable. This includes fiber internet, electricity, water, general cleaning of common areas (because of our helper).<br><br>

The condo has a tennis court, two squash courts, large and deep swimming pool, and game room.<br><br>

Ideal tenant would be a single female that is ok living with a family with a baby soon to be toddler.<br><br><p>Contact Ben at telegram or signal +65.9180.4127 or email ben.t.ball@gmail.com</p></p>
